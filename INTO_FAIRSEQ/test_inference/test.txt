there was once upon a time a king who had a wife with golden hair , and she was so beautiful that you could n't find anyone like her in the world . it happened that she fell ill , and when she felt that she must soon die , she sent for the king , and said , ' if you want to marry after my death , make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as i am , and has just such golden hair as i have . promise me this . ' after the king had promised her this , she closed her eyes and died . for a long time the king was not to be comforted , and he did not even think of taking a second wife . at last his councillors said , ' the king must marry again , so that we may have a queen . ' so messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late queen in beauty . but there was no one in the wide world , and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair . then the messengers came home again , not having been able to find a queen .
now , the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her dead mother , and had just such golden hair . one day when she had grown up , her father looked at her , and saw that she was exactly like her mother , so he said to his councillors , ' i will marry my daughter to one of you , and she shall be queen , for she is exactly like her dead mother , and when i die her husband shall be king . ' but when the princess heard of her father 's decision , she was not at all pleased , and said to him , ' before i do your bidding , i must have three dresses ; one as golden as the sun , one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars .
